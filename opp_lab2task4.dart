// Create a class called Distance that includes two pieces of information as data members - feet (type int), inches (type int).
// Your class should have three constructors which initialize the two data members. 
// Provide setter and getter methods for each data member. Provide a member function displayDistance( ) that displays the feet 
// and inches in the form of 5’6’’. 
// Write a test program that demonstrates class Distance’s capabilities.
