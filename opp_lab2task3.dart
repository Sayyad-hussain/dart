// Create a class called Date that includes three pieces of information as data members; a month (type int), a day (type int), 
// and a year (type int). Your class should have three constructors that initialize the three data members. For the purpose of 
// this exercise, assume that the values provided for the year and day are correct, but ensure that the month value in the range 1-12; 
// if it isn’t, set the month to 1. 
// Provide setter and getter methods for each data member. Provide a member function displayDate() that displays the month, day and 
// year in the provided format, i.e. day – month – year.
// Write a test program that demonstrates class Date’s capabilities.
