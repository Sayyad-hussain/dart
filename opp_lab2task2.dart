// Create a class called MotorVehicle that represents a motor vehicle using data members:              
// make (type string), fuelType (type string), yearOfManufacture (type int), color (type string),
//  and engineCapacity (type int). Your class should have three constructors (default, argument & copy) 
//  that initialize all data members. Provide setter and getter methods for each data member. Add a member 
//  function called displayCardDetails( ) that displays the five data members in five separate lines in the form 
//  “member name: member value”.
// Write a program to demonstrate MotorVehicle’s capabilities.
